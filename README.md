Welcome to my personal portfolio! This website is going to serve as the home base
to all my future project, learning experience and the like! This portfolio was devoloped in part for CS50x,
Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science.

My portfolio, Invincible Miller, is developed in JavaScript, which is my favorite programming language,
and it's using the Next.js framework for SSR and plain old CSS for styling. Behind the scenes, I'm using
Sanity CMS to dynamically load and update content without having to rebuild/redeploy the entire site on every
content update.

CS50x was such an amazing course, and I just want to give a HUGE thank you to all the hands that built it.

### THANK YOU!
