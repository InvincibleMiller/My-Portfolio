Hi, I'm Isaac Miller! I'm a Web Developer based in Ocala, FL, United States. I've been a programmer since I
was 13 years old, and only recently I decided I wanted to make it my career. I started CS50x as a means of
getting back to the Grass Roots of programming and solidifying the fundamentals in my mind. When I was 14,
I built video games with C++, and now I'm focusing on Web Development with TypeScript and JavaScript.

My favorite part of CS50 was the portion on DSA. I'm trying to learn Data Structures and Algorithms to really
take that leap from Web Developer to Software Engineer. But, for now here's something that's light on algorithms...

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This website is going to serve as the home base
for all my future projects, learning experiences and the like! This portfolio was developed in part for CS50x,
Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science, but I mean to make it last for my entire career.

My portfolio, Invincible Miller, is developed in JavaScript, which is my favorite programming language,
and it's using the Next.js framework for SSR and plain old CSS for styling. Behind the scenes, I'm using
Sanity CMS to dynamically load and update content without having to rebuild/redeploy the entire site on every
content update.

CS50x was such an amazing course, and I just want to give a HUGE thank you to all the hands that built it.

### THANK YOU!

## Development

While developing this Web Site I developed strictly by documentation (and with a little help from Google), and
in no time it was finished.

Actually... it's been finished for a while, but I had been focusing on a side project, and I never submitted this
to CS50x! =P
